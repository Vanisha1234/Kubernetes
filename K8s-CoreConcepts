## ETCD

### Overview
- Distributed, reliable **key-value store**
- Stores cluster state
- No schema, no complex queries
- Fast and highly flexible
### Key Details
| Property | Value |
|--------|------|
| Default Port | `2379` |
| Runs As | Pod or system service |
| Client | `etcdctl` |
| Access | Only via Kube-API Server |
### Role in Kubernetes - stores data regarding the cluster which includes - 
- Nodes
- Pods
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Accounts
- Roles & Bindings
- Cluster metadata
  
> ✅ A change is considered complete **only after it is written to ETCD**
### Operational Commands

To check etcd as pod 
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

## KUBE-APISERVER

### Overview
- **Primary management component** in Kubernetes
- Entry point for **all cluster operations**
- All **requests and responses** pass through the Kube-API Server
- **Only component** that communicates directly with **ETCD**
### Responsibilities
- Authenticate users
- Validate API requests
- Retrieve cluster data
- Update ETCD
- Used by **Scheduler** and **Kubelet** to update cluster state
### Operational Commands

Running as a Pod (kubeadm setup)
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
Kube-Api Pod Manifest Location
```bash
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```
Non-kubeadm Setup (Systemd) location
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service
```
To check for running processes
```bash
ps aux | grep kube-apiserver
```

## KUBE CONTROLLER MANAGER

### Overview
- A process that **continuously monitors the state** of various components in a Kubernetes cluster
- Works towards bringing the system to the **desired functioning state**
- Multiple controllers are **packaged into a single process** known as the **Kubernetes Controller Manager**
### Example Controllers
#### Node Controller
- Responsible for monitoring the **status of nodes**
- Takes necessary actions to keep applications running
- Receives node status updates via the **Kube-API Server**
- If there is **no response for more than 40 seconds**, the node is marked as **Unreachable**
- If the node remains unreachable for **more than 5 minutes**, the workloads are **replaced** on healthy nodes
#### Replication Controller
- Responsible for monitoring the **status of ReplicaSets**
- Ensures the **desired number of pods** are available at all times within the set
### Controller Packaging
- Various controllers run together inside a **single binary**
- This unified process is called the **Kubernetes Controller Manager**
### Operational Commands

Running as a Pod (kubeadm setup)
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
Pod Manifest Location
```bash
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
```
Non-kubeadm Setup (Systemd)
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service
```
Verify Running Process
```bash
ps aux | grep kube-controller-manager
```

## KUBE SCHEDULER

### Overview
- Responsible only for deciding which pod goes on which node.
- It does not actually place the pod on a node; it simply selects the best candidate.
- Decides which node has sufficient capacity to accommodate incoming pods.
### Scheduling Logic & Criteria
The scheduler evaluates nodes based on specific logic to ensure optimal placement:
- Resource Prioritization: The scheduler prioritizes the node that will be left with the highest number of available resources even after scheduling the pod.
- Filtering Criteria:
  - Resource Requirements and Limits: Ensures the node meets CPU/Memory requests.
  - Taints and Tolerations: Respects node restrictions.
  - Node Selectors and Affinity: Matches pods to specific node labels or groups.
### Operational Commands

Running as a Pod (kubeadm setup) \
To check the kube-scheduler status when running as a static pod:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
Manifest and Service Locations \
Depending on your installation method, the configuration is found at: \
Pod Definition File:
```bash
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
```
Non-kubeadm Setup (Systemd):
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/kube-scheduler.service
```
Verify Running Process \
To check for the active scheduler process on the host:
```bash
ps aux | grep kube-scheduler
```

## KUBELET

### Overview
- Acts as the sole point of contact between the worker node and the master node.
- The Kubelet on the worker node is responsible for registering the node with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Unlike other components, the Kubelet is always installed manually and not typically run as a container from binaries.
### Responsibilities
The Kubelet manages the lifecycle of pods and maintains communication with the control plane:
- Container Management: Responsible for the loading and unloading of containers.
- Execution Flow:
  - Receives instructions to load a container/pod on a worker node.
  - Requests the Container Runtime (present on the worker node) to pull the necessary image and run the container.
- Monitoring & Reporting:
  - Monitors the health of both nodes and pods.
  - Sends status reports and updates to the Kube-API Server on a timely basis.
### Operational Commands

Since the Kubelet runs as a system service rather than a pod, you can check its status using the following command:
```bash
ps aux | grep kubelet
```

---

## KUBE PROXY

### Overview
- In order to make services accessible throughout the cluster, kube-proxy is used and is installed on every node.
- It is responsible for creating rules on each node every time a new service is created to forward the traffic to that service.
> Kube-proxy manages the network traffic flow by interacting with the node's networking stack:
- It dynamically updates the networking rules to ensure traffic destined for a Service reaches the correct Pod.
- It primarily performs these updates using iptables rules.
### Operational Commands

In most clusters (like those set up with kubeadm), kube-proxy runs as a DaemonSet with a pod on every node. You can verify its status using:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

---

## PODS

### Overview
- Containers are not deployed directly in Kubernetes; they are encapsulated into Kubernetes objects called Pods.
- A Pod represents a single instance of an application and is the smallest object in a Kubernetes cluster.
- If load increases, a new pod with a container is deployed, or a new node with a new pod is added to the cluster.
  - Scaling up spins up more pods, while scaling down removes them.
- A pod can contain two containers of different types, but generally not of similar types.
- Pods establish all network connectivity automatically when a separate container is created inside them. Even with a single container, pods are used to ensure easy scaling for future architectural changes.
### Basic Commands
To deploy a pod:
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image nginx
```
List Pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Detailed Info about a Pod:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
To delete a Pod:
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```
### Pod Definition File
Kubernetes objects are typically defined using YAML files for declarative management:
```bash
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
      app: myapp-pod
      type: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-cont
      image: nginx
```
### Managing Pod Configurations
To deploy from a pod definition file:
```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```
Or
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

To change a running pod directly:
```bash
kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
```
After saving, apply changes using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

To edit a pod created via vi, vim or nano tool:
```bash
vim pod.yaml
```
Apply changes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```







REPLICATION CONTROLLER & REPLICASETS
Helps to prevent downtime by maintaining the desired number of pods at all times for high availability.
It can also replace an existing unhealthy pod if the desired number of pod is just 1.
It is also responsible for load balancing and scaling across multiple pods as well as multiple nodes in case of increasing load.

Replication-controller definition file - rc.yaml
apiVersion: v1 
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc
  labels:
      app: myapp
      type: frontend
spec:
  template: #template block to define the pod definition file for which replications will be created.
     metadata:
       name: myapp
       labels:
          app: myapp-pod
          type: frontend
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx-cont
           image: nginx
  replicas: 3 #number of replicas

To create a replication controller definition file - kubectl create -f rc.yaml
To list replicasets - kubectl get replicationcontroller

ReplicaSet definition file - rs.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-replicaset
  labels:
      app: myapp
      type: frontend
spec:
  template: #template block to define the pod definition file for which replications will be created.
     metadata:
       name: myapp
       labels:
          app: myapp-pod
          type: frontend
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx-cont
           image: nginx
  replicas: 3 #number of replicas
  selector: #helps replicaset identify what pods falls under it
     matchLabels:
        type: frontend
To update a replicaset - kubectl scale --replicas=6 rs.yaml
Another way is to update the yaml file and run - kubectl replace -f rs.yaml ; to replace the replicaset

DEPLOYMENT
Responsible for:
Deploying multiple instances of webserver
To update multiple docker instances seamlessly using rolling update strategy
To carry out easy rollbacks incase of bugs and issues seamlessly altogether.
To make changes to application running on multiple docker instances

Pod help us deploying the single instance of our application; replicaset help us deploy mutliple pods; deployment allow us to upgrade the underlying instances seamlessly
Deployment definition file - (Similar to replicaset just the kind changes)
apiVersion: apps/v1 
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-replicaset
  labels:
      app: myapp
      type: frontend
spec:
  template: 
     metadata:
       name: myapp
       labels:
          app: myapp-pod
          type: frontend
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: nginx-cont
           image: nginx
  replicas: 3 #number of replicas
  selector: 
     matchLabels:
        type: frontend

To create a deployment - kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
To list deployments - kubectl get deployments
Deployment automatically creates a replicaset hence run - kubectl get replicaset; to list replicaset created
Replicaset automatically created pods hence run - kubectl get pods; to list the running pods
To list all the created objects at one run - kubectl get all 

SERVICES
Enables Communication between various components within and outside the application; like connects frontend with backend pods
Helps connect different applications and users
Services enabling loose coupling between microservices in our application

In case of external communication
If we need to communicate with the application hosted on a pod, from outside the K8s cluster, we can use services insted on logging into the Node and then accessing.
Since usecase of services include- listening on the port of the node and then forwarding requests to the port on the pod hosting the application. This type of service is known as node port service.
Target port - The port on the pod; where the service forwards the request to.
Port - The port on the service itself; the service has a virtual IP assigned to it known as cluster IP.
NodePort - The port on the node. Node port has a range : 30000 - 32767

Service Definition File of type NodePort- svc.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort #type of service
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 #if targetPort is not provided, it will automatically pick up the same port of the port.
      port: 80 #this is important to provide
      nodePort: 30008 #if not provide, will be automatically set to any port between the valid range
  selector: #labels and selectors will be used to link the service to the pod to which the request is to be forwarded
      app: myapp
      type: frontend

To create a service - kubectl create -f svc.yml
To list the services - kubectl get services
To describe a service - kubectl describe service serviceName
We can now browse the application using the IP of the Node and the Port on the Node.

Cluster Ip type of service- Virtual Ip created inside the cluster used to enable communication between different services like set of frontend servers communicating to set of backend services
In case of various services running for eg set of frontend webservers and set of backen webservers; both needs to commnicate with each other but ips of pods are not static and may change if a pod is replaced hence it is not reliable for internal communication.
Secondly it becomes difficult to decide which pod instance to forward traffic to when all are same.
Hence this service helps in grouping the same pods together and provide a single interface to communicate.
Each service is assigned a name and the ip which will be used by pods for communication.

Service definition file of type Cluster IP- svc.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  type: ClusterIP #if type of service is not specified;this is the default svc type
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80 #port where backend is exposed
      port: 80 
  selector: #to link svc to backend pods
      app: myapp
      type: backend

The svc can be accessed by the pods using the clusterIP or the service name.

Load balancer type of service- Helps to distribute load across various webservers
In case of multiple pod instances running of the same application , each pod has same labels which is used in Load balancer service to link all the pods with same labels.
Once the pods are linked using labels, the service then automatically use all the pods as the endpoints to forward the request.
This service acts as a built in loadbalancer to distribute load.

In case of pods present in different nodes inside the cluster; no additional configuration is required; k8s automatically spans across the nodes in the cluster and map the target port to the same nodePort on all the nodes in the cluster. This way the application can be access through any ip and the same port.
Services are automatically updated if pos are added or removed.

NAMESPACES
An isolated environment that contains all the services like pods, svcs and deployments. There can be various namespaces like dev, prod and test. To isolate these environments namespaces are created so that users dont end up accidently making changes to another environment.
The resources within the namespace can refer to each other by their names.
To connect to service in the another namespace for eg - connection web pod to db pod in another namespace; we need to use - servicename.namespace.svc.cluster.local
To list the pods in a specific namespace - kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
To create a pod in a specific namespace - kubectl create -f pod.yml --namespace=blue-namespace
To avoid using namespaces in commands repeatedly, define namespace under metadata of the pod definition file.

Namespace definition file- ns.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev

To create using definition file - kubectl create -f ns.yml
To create directly without creating def. file - kubectl create namespace dev
To avoid specifying ns repeatedly while running commands use - kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=dev
To view pod in all the namespaces - kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

To limit resources of a namespace like cpu or memory usage; create a resource quota
Resource Quota definition file - rq.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 5Gi
    limits.cpu: "10"
    limits.memory: 10 Gi
    
 To create resource quota via definition file - kubectl create -f rq.yaml     
  
IMPERATIVE & DECLARATIVE
Imperative Approach means specifying what and how to do.
Declarative Approach means specifying what to do instead of specifying the details. The rest is handled by the system itself.

Example of Imperative Approach
Imperative commands run once and require long commands in case of complex environments. They are limited to user who ran these commands. Difficult to keep track of.
To create a pod - kubectl run --image=nginx nginx                                               |
To create a deployment - kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx                          |  --------> To create an object
To create a service to expose deployment - kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80            |

To edit the existing object - kubectl edit deployment nginx                                     |
To scale a deployment - kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5                             |  ---------> To update an object
to update an image on deployment - kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.18          |
To create an object specifying file - kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
To edit an object specifying file - kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml
To delete an object specifying file - kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml

To create , update and delete an object - kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
We create yaml files, which are easy to keep trackof, easy to share and update.
Ways of editing the existing object
1. if used - kubectl edit deployment nginx
This command will open similar yaml file that was used to create an object but with additional fields - This is not the file used to create an object. This is similar yaml file in k8s memory and changes made to it will be applied on live.
However, there is a difference between local yaml file and the k8s memory yaml file-
The changes applied to k8s memory yaml file are not recorded anywhere and once the changes are made, we are left with local file which has no changes in it.
2. Better approach is to make changes to local yaml file and then run - kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml
3. To completely delete of recreate an object - kubectl replace --force -f nginx.yaml


Examples of Declarative Approach
In case of Declarative approach we use the same yaml files that was used in imperative approach but in-place of create or replace commands we use - kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml; to manage the object
Kubectl apply command is intelligent enough to create an object if it doesnt exist.
To create multiple objects, the objects can be specifies in a directory and the directory path can be provided to the apply command - kubectl apply -f /path/to/directory
To update the existing fie, changes are to be made in congif file and the command to be run is - kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml

To create a pod - kubectl run nginx --image=nginx ; Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) -  kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
To create a deployment - kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx ; Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) - kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
To save the YAML definition file generated to a file and modify - kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas - kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4
Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379 - kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:] - kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
To create a service and simultaneously create a pod and expose it, run - kubectl run httpd --image=httpd:alpine --port=80 --expose (service name and pod name will be same)

KUBECTL COMMAND
To list all resources - kubectl api-resources ; list names , shortnames, apiVersions and other details about all the resources.
to explain an object, run - kubectl explain pod ; For details - kubectl explain pod --recursive

KUBECTL APPLY COMMAND
Kubectl apply command stores the changes made to last applied configuration file .
All the three file - local file, last applied config file and the kubernetes memory file are compared and the final changes are identified to be applied.
last applied config file help us keep track of what changes are made when the files are compared.
